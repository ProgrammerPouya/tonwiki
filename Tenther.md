These are users who placed the **Top 10%** of participants or achieved something of similar equivalence. 

There is a separate competitive bracket among these users called the [[Tenther Leaderboard]] where they gain [[Tenters]] from placing high enough to prevent someone else from getting to [[Tenther]] status.

The next rank is [[Percenter]].
