The **Tower of Nitro** (`ToN`), also know as [The Nitro Games], is a Discord-based social multiplayer game made by [[Doteki]] where Discord users compete in a series of minigames for a 1 month free subscription of Discord Nitro Premium. It was originally created as a protest against the large-scale "invite 5 people for Discord Nitro" scandals popular during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

The minigames in `ToN` are set up as [[Stages]] which are "climbed" in order to beat the game. In each [Stage], a number of participants are eliminated. This is how the original participant count—typically a number around `100` users—is reduced to a single winner. Each [Stage] will put the user's Discording skills to the test: charisma in your interactions with others, judgement in the sides you pick, analytical skills in the [[Stages]] you decipher, logic in your approach to each minigame, speed in your responses, and precision with your actions.

There were also smaller scale games created due to community engagement: most prominently, [[Pillar of Nitro]], [[Tower of Percenter]], [[Tower of Crab]], and [[Tower of War]]. Note that some of these games took place *beyond* Discord, but the general idea of `ToN` stayed firmly inside the Discord app.
## The Nitro Games (`ToN1`)

Also referred to as the **First Tower of Nitro** (`ToN1`), [The Nitro Games] Discord server was made up of users invited by [[Doteki]] from various communities such as **Vesteria**, **Feudal Japan**, and friends or acquaintances from real-life. 

To effectively jumpstart `ToN1` (and `ToN` in general), [[Doteki]] aimed to recruit `~100` users to participate in his Discord game—at that time was a casual social experiment. This led to the registration of users with numbers ranging from `01` to `99` (now known as the [[001-099]] group). The first `~50` or so users were recruited in the first day, and the next `~50` joined by the first week. Out of the `~100` users assembled, only `~80` actually participated, as many left the server before it truly started or did not participate in [[Stage 0]] to be truly called participants.

`ToN1` was set up in `11` stages ranging from [[Stage 0]] to [[Stage 10]]. The entirety of `ToN1` was run by [[Doteki]]. This Tower lasted a full week before concluding with [[026]] becoming the first winner of a tower.
