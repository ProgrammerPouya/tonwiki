Starting from [[Number]], users in [[ToN]] are given a [[Code Name]] to go by rather than their ordinary name, username or nickname. This is typically represented by a 3 digit number ranging from `000-999`. As of `ToN7`, the highest number assigned is, *ironically*, `404` (*which is no longer in the Discord as of April 4th, 2025*).

After winning a `ToN` and becoming a [[Letter]], a user has the opportunity to 'upgrade' to having a single letter as their name. For each `ToN` that is then won, an additional letter can be added before or after the current name (or between letters, if the user is already a [[Worder]]).

## Trivia
* During `The Nitro Games` (`ToN1`), the [[Code Name]] range was only a 2 digit number ranging from `00-99`. This was expanded following the influx of new members, boosting the Discord server member count beyond `100`.
