| [[Doteki]] | Overseer and founder of Tower of Nitro                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 000        | An alias held by [[Doteki]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [[003]]    | A former [[Tenther]]. This user probably had the highest cooperation in making [[ToN]] possible, inviting well over `30` users during the server's infancy.                                                                                  |
| [[004]]    | A [[Number]]. One of the most prominent players in  [[ToN]], and one who has ironically never managed to land in [[Tenther]] status despite participating in all [[ToN]]s.                                                                   |

| [[008]]    | Also a [[Tenther]], plus a former [[Director]]. Professional [[AnR]] player. Survived the longest time in `Baras` (3 days).                                                                                                                  |
| [[009]]    | A [[Percenter]]. This user was the first to receive the `Murderer` title.                                                                                                                                                                    |

| [[014]]    | A [[Tenther]] and one of the [[Rankers]]. Most rules in the server were created after witnessing [[014]]'s unorthodox messages.                                                                                                              |
| 015        | A former [[Number]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| [[024]]    | A [[Letter]]. This user is the only one that holds the `Reaper` title, accomplished for indirectly causing the elimination of more than `1/3rd` of all participants.                                                                         |
| [[017]]    | A [[Letter]]. Some other titles include `Strategist`, `False Hero`, `Zombie`, and `Grandmaster`. Also part of the [[Rankers]].                                                                                                               |
| [[026]]    | A [[Worder]]. That's right, this is the only user to win more than one [[ToN]] currently.                                                                                                                                                    |
| 029        | A [[Number]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [[033]]    | A [[Percenter]], and the very first [[AnR]] player. This user holds the unique `Harbinger` title. One of the most knowledgeable [[ToN]] players.                                                                                             |
| 034        | A [[Tenther]].                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[035]]    | A [[Letter]]. This user is also a `Crab Lord`. Often, he is found at the center of [[ToN]] drama and fighting, either being eliminated early on or reaching the very end. Coincidentally, he also has the `Gladiator` title to back that up. |
| 039        | A [[Percenter]] and former member of the [[Rankers]].                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[042]]    | A [[Number]] and former [[Director]]. This user has the longest ongoing run in all of [[AnR]], which is still ongoing.                                                                                                                       |
| [[044]]    | A [[Number]]. This user is a member of [REDACTED].                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 045        | A [[Number]], rumored to be in cahoots with [[044]].                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [[-049]]   | A [[Number]], the first to complete the [[Devil]] contract, leading to the disbursement of the `False Hero` titles. His performance in the first couple of towers are well known, and he is a part of a couple of memes on the server.       |
| [[051]]    | A [[Number]]. The first [[Director]] and current the lead for the team. This user only participated in the first [[ToN]] but was a staple for the continuation of the towers.                                                                |
| [[052]]    | A [[Percenter]] and apart of the [[Rankers]]. This user lands in the top scorers frequently despite rarely engaging in PvP activities.                                                                                                       |
| [[054]]    | A [[Letter]]. Don't let the anime girls fool you, this user is a beast.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 069        | A [[Number]]. This user really only participated in the first [[ToN]], but along with [[024]] they created the first mass-PvP situation.                                                                                                     |
| [[-080]]   | A [[Tenther]] and the second [[Devil]] contractee to succeed.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 091        | A [[Number]]. This user created the OG [[ToN]] Discord gif logo.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| [[099]]    | A [[Number]]. This rowdy user was both involved in [[AnR]] and [[ToN]] activities. However, she departed from the server never to return.                                                                                                    |
| [[102]]    | A [[Number]] and former [[Director]]. This user was also involved with [[AnR]] at its beginnings.                                                                                                                                            |

| [[116]]    | A [[Tenther]] also the only [[Fangel]]. This user's actions have always been unorthodox, so its no surprise he ended up completing a non-existent contract.                                                                                  |
| [[126]]    | A [[Tenther]] and [[Director]]. This user a memester through and through, competing with the likes of [[014]] and [[052]].                                                                                                                   |
| 129        | A [[Number]]. In cahoots with 375. However, the user's existence is a testament to the past and cannot be ignored.                                                                                                                           |
| [[172]]    | A [[Number]] and [[Director]]. The second most involved user in [[AnR]]. Also, coincidentally, the person who taught me how to make wikis like these!                                                                                        |
| [[177]]    | A [[Percenter]] and the [[Champion]]. This user rejected to become a [[Letter]], resulting in her unique status. Also a former [[Director]].                                                                                                 |
| [[178]]    | A [[Percenter]] and [[AnR]] player. This user is the only [[Percenter]] without any titles (which is an accomplishment in itself). He loves to talk about maids and his character Cranel!                                                    |
| 201        | A [[Number]] and former [[Director]].                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [[221]]    | A [[Number]] and former [[Director]]. "A freak in the (google) sheets" - [[ToN]] 4-5 activities.                                                                                                                                             |
| 229        | A [[Percenter]]. Wait, when did that happen?! (I'm losing it.)                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [[254]]    | A [[Tenther]], also one of few `Dynoslayers`. A storm is kicked up wherever this user goes.                                                                                                                                                  |
