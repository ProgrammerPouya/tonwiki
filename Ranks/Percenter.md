Typically given in special circumstances, like a [[Tower of Percenter]] or to the winner of a [[Pillar of Nitro]]. This makes it as coveted as becoming a [[Letter]], but a few times easier to achieve.

Starting from `ToN5`, `Percenter` became the default rank given to the **2nd Place** winner of a [[ToN]].

The next rank—achieved through winning a `ToN`—is [[Letter]].
